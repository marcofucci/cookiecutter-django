PLEASE NOTE
===========

I moved the code to a brand new repo as pydanny's and mine have been created for different purposes.

This space will not be updated so please go to https://github.com/marcofucci/cookiecutter-simple-django and watch / fork that repo instead.


cookiecutter-django
=======================

A cookiecutter_ template for Django.

.. _cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter

Description
-----------

Lighter version of the Daniel Greenfeld's cookiecutter-django.

It uses the latest stable versions and it only defines a skeleton which can be extended as needed.

Usage
------

Let's pretend you want to create a Django project called "redditclone". Rather than using `startproject`
and then editing the results to include your name, email, and various configuration issues that always get forgotten until the worst possible moment, get cookiecutter_ to do all the work.

First, get cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome::

Set up your virtualenv::

    $ cd <your-envs-folder>
    $ virtualenv  --no-site-packages redditclone
    $ cd redditclone
    $ source bin/activate
    $ pip install cookiecutter

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cd <your-workspace>
    $ cookiecutter  https://github.com/marcofucci/cookiecutter-simple-django.git

You'll be prompted for some questions, answer them, then it will create a Django project for you.


**Warning**: After this point, change 'Marco Fucci', etc to your own information.

It prompts you for questions. Answer them::

    author_name (default is "Your Name")? Marco Fucci
    email (default is "Your email")? <your-email>
    description (default is "A short description of the project.")? A reddit clone
    year (default is "Current year")? 2013

Enter the project and take a look around::

    $ cd redditclone/
    $ ls
    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt
    $ python ./manage.py syncdb
    $ python ./manage.py migrate
    $ python ./manage.py runserver

and load localhost:8000/admin


Create a GitHub repo and push it there::

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit!"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:marcofucci/redditclone.git
    $ git push -u origin master

Now take a look at your repo. Awesome, right?

It's time to write the code!!!

experience better.
